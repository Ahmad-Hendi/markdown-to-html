            <h3>FUNNY STORY</h3>
            <p>In my junior year of high school, this guy asked me on a date. He rented a Redbox movie and made a pizza.
                We were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza was done. He looked me dead in the eye and said,
                ‚ÄúThis is the worst part.‚Äù I then watched this boy open the oven and pull the pizza out with his bare hands,
                rack and all, screaming at the top of his lungs. We never had a second date. </p>
